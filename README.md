## Introduction

This repository serves as a practical guide for software developers to understand and implement various design patterns and low-level system designs. The examples provided cover a range of scenarios and use cases, making it easier to apply these concepts in real-world projects.

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation. This section includes:

- **Singleton**
- **Factory Method**
- **Abstract Factory**
- **Builder**
- **Prototype**

### Structural Patterns

Structural patterns ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities. This section includes:

- **Adapter**
- **Bridge**
- **Composite**
- **Decorator**
- **Facade**
- **Flyweight**
- **Proxy**

### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. This section includes:

- **Chain of Responsibility**
- **Command**
- **Interpreter**
- **Iterator**
- **Mediator**
- **Memento**
- **Observer**
- **State**
- **Strategy**
- **Template Method**
- **Visitor**

## Low-Level System Design

This section covers the design of individual components and subsystems within a larger system, focusing on the following areas:

- **Object-Oriented Design Principles**
- **Designing Classes and Methods**
- **Handling Concurrency and Multithreading**
- **Designing Scalable Systems**
- **Database Design and Optimization**
- **APIs and Microservices Design**

Each topic is accompanied by detailed explanations, UML diagrams, and code examples to illustrate key concepts and best practices.
